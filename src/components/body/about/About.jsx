       <p>
        I'm an ex Advertising creative who loves building things with code.
        I've always been a curious creative so one day when my friend told me about a website
        they had built from scratch using Javascript, I was amazed and as a person
        who loves to create.</p>
        <p>I began to learn Javascript the following week and I was soon able to build
        my own simple websites. I've self-taught for a year, coding almost every day and since starting
        my coding career, I've really grown as a developer yet I'm still seeking to learn more to raise
        my standards for what's expected of web applications.
        </p>
        <p>I'm excited for where my career will take me and I'm currently looking for a role where I can contribute
        my skills in coding and creativity.</p>
